Cardioversion Note: 

A time-out was performed identifying the patient, physician, and procedure.  There were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff. The patient participated actively in this. 

The patient was placed in the supine position and hands free patches were placed in the {JMH Single Wild Card:50000::"anterior-lateral","anterior-posterior"} position.

The patient received {1-4:31454} synchronized cardioversion attempt(s) with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm. This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.
