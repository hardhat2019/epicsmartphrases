Intermediate Laceration Repair Procedure Note:
Total length [<2.5, 2.6-5, 5.1-7.5, 7.6-12.5, 12.6-20, 20.1-30, >30], specifically *** cm.
Wound anesthetized with *** cc of {meds; anesthetics local:16397}. 

After irrigation with normal saline under pressure with debridement and removal of particulate matter as appropriate, wound explored and no foreign body appreciated, no evidence or tendon or deep structure injury. {NUMBERS 1-5:20334}-0 {Devices; suture material:11071} were placed in deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia to relieve wound tension. Subsequently, {NUMBERS 1-5:20334}-0 {Devices; suture material:11071} were placed superficially using simple interrupted technique in the typical fashion. Wound edges well approximated, hemostasis achieved, tolerated well, no complications.   Patient/family given explicit wound care, surveillance, and follow up instructions.  Sterile dressing applied.
