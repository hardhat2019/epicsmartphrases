A 2 cm skin incision was made in the mid-axillary line at the infra-mammary crease. Utilizing blunt dissection, a subcutaneous tunnel was created cephalad just adjacent to the superior rib. The pleural space was entered bluntly and gush of  {Blank single:19197::"blood","air"} was observed. A finger was inserted into the pleural space to check for anatomy and guide tube insertion.
