Endotracheal Intubation

Indication: Respiratory Distress

A time-out was completed verifying correct patient, procedure, site, positioning, and special equipment if applicable. 

The patient was placed in a flat position. Sedation was obtained using {Blank single:19197::"ketamine","propofol","versed","etomidate"} and the paralytic ({Blank single:19197::"succinylcholine","rocuronium"}) was provided. The patient was easily ventilated using an ambu bag. The {Blank single:19197::"glidescope","direct laryngoscope"} was used and inserted into the oropharynx at which time there was a Grade 1 view of the vocal cords. A ***-french endotracheal tube was inserted and visualized going through the vocal cords. The stylet was removed. Colorimetric change was visualized on the CO2 meter. Breath sounds were heard in both lung fields equally. The endotracheal tube was placed at *** cm, measured at the teeth. 

A chest x-ray was ordered to assess for pneumothorax and verify endotracheal tube placement. 

The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
