Shoulder Reduction Procedure Note:

The patient was consented regarding the risks and benefits of reduction.  The site was manipulated using traction and countertraction to accomplish optimal anatomical alignment.

The site was then immobilized using a [sugar tong splint] that was placed under my direct supervision.

Postprocedure exam was completed and there are [no neurovascular deficits detected]. Tolerated well, no complications observed. Post reduction x-rays of the were completed and reviewed by myself.

2 person Cunningham technique

1.  Patient and clinician are positioned facing each other.  Bed height raised so the patient is slightly elevated relative to the clinician's seated position with their relaxed forearm resting (horizontally) on clinician's shoulder.

2.  Patient's shoulders are rotated/shrugged backwards and kept even, chest is pushed out, back is straightened, and head is lifted up similar to a wall sit.

3.  Patient breathes slowly in and out, focusing on relaxing their muscles and rotating their shoulders backward.

4.  Clinician massages the patient's deltoid/biceps with their contralateral hand

5.  Clinician uses their ipsilateral hand to apply gentle straight downward traction to the elbow while adducting it against the patient's side.

6.  Clinician's assistant (positioned behind the patient) helps to maintain the shoulders square, shoulders rotated backwards while massaging the trapezius
